Running each executable without the library being present:

$ ./M1
Enter the first integer : 1
Enter the second integer : 2
Enter the third integer : 3
The sum of 1 2 3 is ... 6
$ ./M2
Enter the first integer : 1
Enter the second integer : 2
Enter the third integer : 3
The sum of 1 2 3 is ... 6
$ ./M3
ld.so.1: M3: fatal: libcode.so: open failed: No such file or directory
Killed
$

M3 fails because it is a shared library and was not placed into the executable.
